# Fitness & Sleep Analysis: Understanding the Relationship Between Exercise and Sleep
# Overview
This project explores the relationship between fitness activities (workouts, heart rate, calories burned) and sleep quality using self-collected data from Mac+ (for fitness) and Apple Health (for sleep tracking). The goal is to identify trends and correlations that may impact overall health and well-being.
# Motivation
Even with all the school work and social life I try to do fitness as much as I can and try to make it a habit to have a healthy lifestyle. But just going to the gym and working out is not enough. Matter of fact the most important thing in fitness is not lifting heavy weights or diet, it is actually sleep or sleep schedule. And that is where I lack. I can't seem to have a healthy sleep schedule because of all the things I told before (School, social life, etc.). And with this project I can clearly see the impact that sleep has on my fitness program and maybe it might motivate me to fix it.
